## Getting Started

The backend application is a Spring Boot 3 application that requires Java 21 and uses Gradle
as a build tool.

* Install a OpenJDK 21 distribution (e.g. [Eclipse Temurinâ„¢](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)).
* Install Docker and Docker compose
* Clone the repository.
* Run the application with `./gradlew bootRun`.
* The application should be shortly available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Development

* Build and test application with `./gradlew build`
* Code style is enforced using Spotless and Checkstyle (based on Google Java Style).
  * You can format the code with `./gradlew spotlessApply`.
  * If using IntelliJ IDEA, the Checkstyle-IDEA and google-java-format plugins are recommended.

### Database migrations

The database migrations are managed with Flyway, located in the
`src/main/resources/db/migration` directory. The migrations should be named in the format
`V<yyymmdd>.<id>__<description>.sql`, where `<id>` is the Jira issue number of the migration, and
`<description>` is a short description of the migration. For example,
`V20250708.1234__add_new_table.sql`.
